# hello-world
Beginning my journey through Github
This is Aditya! I am a web developer and software developer. I completed my masters degree in computer science from Washington State University in machine learning and data science. I am a coding enthusiast and my journey includes learning new technologies. Currently, I am practising creating websites and applications using reactJS with a touch of NodeJS (for back-end connectivity). My repositories mostly includes my projects which I create while learning a new technology.
